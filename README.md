Project Summary
The Recipe Recommender system aims to provide users with personalized recipes to help with discovering new meals based on their 
initial taste preferences and skill level. Users will complete a survey and based on their responses, will then be suggested a meal to cook. 
Everytime a user returns they will be asked about their previous suggested meal, and based on their feedback, will be given an updated survey 
to complete for another recipe. 

Project Goals 

The main goals of this project are to:


Develop a user friendly web application which allows users to complete a survey and be provided with a recipe based on their responses.   

Implement a feedback loop to restructure the survey so users will always be provided with an updated survey and suggested a new recipe.

Help with discovering and trying different recipes based on personal food tastes.

Product Features
App: Our application will be fully functional on Chrome (both desktop and Android). 
Survey: The survey will be a closed-ended (Dynamic) Survey. The survey will have the ability to change which items and 
response options users receive based on prior choices. The question order and choices change using adaptive logic(numerical algorithms).

Feedback Loop: The client will complete a survey and provide feedback on their experience with said 
recommendations during their next visit to the web application. Future surveys will use prior responses to provide unique, accurate recommendations.

Filtering: Ability to filter and sort results by ingredients, complexity, region/style, time to make, experience level,and meal type.

Login: Optional feature for users who want to save their recipes, but Admins will be required to have login details.

Admin: After authentication via username and password, an admin can download 
client data and history from one or more clients, as well as view, update or create a client profile.

Data Tracking: All questions and responses per client, as well as time completed, will be tracked. An admin can view and download 
any clients survey history.


Limitations
Limitations of our project include but are not limited to the following:

The application cannot differentiate users with multiple profiles

The application is not responsible for the safety of users, including but not limited to injury or death caused by recipes from food 
allergies, choking, and burns. 

Not knowing the number of recommendations a user will reject, before finding 
the right recipe

User identification methods without requiring a registered account
